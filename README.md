# Basic_Keylogger
This Python code implements a basic keylogger using the pynput library. A keylogger is a program that monitors and logs keystrokes. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

keyPressed Function:

This function is triggered whenever a key is pressed.
It attempts to log the character representation of the key (key.char) into a file named keyfile.txt.
If the key is not a character (e.g., a special or control key), it catches the exception and prints an error message.
Keyboard Listener:

A keyboard.Listener object is created and configured to call the keyPressed function whenever a key is pressed.
The listener is started with listener.start() to run in the background.
Logging Keystrokes:

Each key pressed is appended to the file keyfile.txt to create a log of all keystrokes.
Waiting for User Input:

input() is used to keep the program running until the user manually stops it.
Keylogger Warning:
Keyloggers are often associated with malicious activity, such as capturing passwords or sensitive information without consent. If used for ethical or educational purposes, ensure compliance with legal and ethical guidelines, and obtain consent from all involved parties.
